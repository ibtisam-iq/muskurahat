# 😊 Muskurahat

**Muskurahat** (Urdu: مسکراہٹ) means **Smile** — and _Ibtisam_ means the same.

This repository is a celebration of who I am, told through the languages I use every day — YAML, Shell, Python, and more.

Each file is not just code, but a reflection of my identity as a DevOps Engineer on a journey toward AIOps and beyond.
