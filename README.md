# 😊 Muskurahat

**Muskurahat** (Urdu: مسکراہٹ) means **Smile** — and _Ibtisam_ means the same.

This repository is my **personal introduction, expressed through code** —  
written in the languages and formats that shape my daily work as a DevOps Engineer.

From YAML to Shell to Python, each file is a different way to say the same thing:

> **"Hello, I'm Muhammad Ibtisam Iqbal."**

Muskurahat is not just a smile — it’s a technical self-portrait.  
It reflects my background, my mindset, and my passion for automation, systems, and continuous learning.
